								<h2>Software Development</h2>
								<p>
									My journey with Software Development has been one of the most influencial parts of who I am. 
									I have always loved computers and how they work, so when I found out that I could make my field of study, I knew that I had found what I wanted to do in life.
								</p>
								<img src="images/idtech_logo.png" alt="Image of ID Tech Logo" class="idtech_logo" width="280px" height="92px">
								<p>
									My first experience with coding was when I was still a kid with the "ID Tech" Summer Camp, held at Colorado State University. 
									There I learned how to make a very simple mod for a video game, but ever since then, I was hooked to the concept, and my love for computers grew stronger.
								</p>
								<p>
									Into highschool and college, I began to dive deeper into the field, and began to learn all the fundamentals of coding. 
									It didn't matter what flavor of Computer Science there was, I was interested in it all. However, I grew particularly fond of Systems Engineering and Software Development.
									The concept of being able to see a problem and do something to solve it is an awesome thing, and I always find fulfillment out of being able to solve problems for other people.

								<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/bronson_logo.png" alt="Image of Bronson Logo" class="bronson_logo" width="280px" height="92px"></a>
								<p>
									Bronson, the web development project I've been working on for the University of Wyoming, has been one of the most exciting projects I have had the privilege to work on.
									When I first joined the IT department with the Classroom Technology Services (CTS) division, I just started out as a student field technician - going around campus fixing the technology in all the classrooms.
									A few of the techs had started Bronson as a CTS project, and as a field tech I saw a way to add to it with my tool, Tickex.
								</p>
								<p>
									The University of Wyoming uses TeamDynamix's ticket system to track maintenence requests, issues, tutorials, etc... 
									Our division, CTS, heavily relies on this system, so I saw it fit that Bronson have capabilities to serve tickets to field techs.
									My Tickex application includes API handling, user authentication, front-end and back-end development, and intelligent organization algorithms to function as efficiently as possible - all autonomously!
								</p>

									TODO: Talk about Primetime Paradox project here. Image, description, link to github repo through image.
								</p>
								<p>
									Nowadays, I am currently working on web development for the University of Wyoming IT department, working on my senior capstone project, and developing various personal projects in my spare time.
									I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and a person. I always seek to contribute to innovative projects, and am excited for what the future holds!

								<h2>Education & Course Work</h2>
								<p>
									TODO: Add GPA and honors here (highschool and college)
								</p>
								<p>
									I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Wyoming, with an expected graduation date of May 2026.
									My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in Computer Science principles, as well as practical experience in various programming languages and advancing technologies.
								</p>

									<img src="images/uw_logo.png" alt="Image of University of Wyoming Logo" class="uw_logo" width="350px" height="100px">
								</a>
								<p>
									Some of the courses I have taken include Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux Operating Systems, VR/AR Systems, Compiler Systems, Cybersecurity, 
										Database Systems, Mobile Programming, Functional Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Computability and Complexity Theory, and Software Design. 
									Mathematics courses such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Discrete Mathematics have also been part of my curriculum.
								</p>
								<p>
									These courses have not only taught me strong technical skills, but also critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills that are essential in the field of Computer Science.
									I am excited to continue my education and further develop my skills as a Software Developer.

								<h2>Leadership & Qualifications</h2>
								<p>
									In a lot of aspects of my life, I tend to be a central figure when it comes to leading groups of people to achieve a common task.
									In some scenarios, there might not even be any proper leadership role, yet I still find myself taking the initiative in many ways.
									I have strong social skills, and I am able to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life, which leads me to being a natural leader in many situations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Talk about academic leadership roles here - National honors society, graduating top of my class
								</p>
								<p>
									Talk about job experiences here - Field Tech at UW IT, Web Developer at UW IT, Restaurant jobs customer service experience
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Leadership in Music</h2>
								<p>
									Starting from highschool and leading up to the present, I was always involved in a vast number of musical ensembles.
									Concert bands, jazz bands, pep bands, and marching band were all a big part of my highschool experience, and they were also a large contributor to my personal growth.
									In jazz band, I was the drumset player for 3 years, and was a major proponent of the rhythm section - helping to keep the band in time and providing a solid foundation for the rest of the band to build upon.
									In marching band, I was a Section Leader for my junior year, and then promoted to the band's Drum Major for my senior year - leading rehearsals, conducting performances, and being the command between the band director and the rest of the band members.
								</p>

									<img src="images/wtmb_logo.png" alt="Image of UW Marching Band Drumline" class="wtmb_logo" width="200px" height="200px">
								</a>
								<p>
									At the University of Wyoming, I have been involved in the Western Thunder Marching Band as a percussionist for the 2021 & 2022 seasons, and have took on the role of Section Leader for the 2022 season.
									After two seasons being a student member, I was promoted to the staff side - being a the Drumline Instructor for the 2023, 2024, and 2025 seasons.
									This role involves planning rehearsals, teaching marching techniques, and being a mentor and role model to the percussion section members.
									During the off-season I also offer private drum lessons to members of the percussion section, as well as other students on campus.

								</a>
								<p>
									This trend in music leadership roles did not stop here. 
									In the professional marching band world of Drum Corps International, I have been a member of the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (2021 & 2022 seasons) and the Blue Knights Drum and Bugle Corps (2023 & 2024 seasons).
									In the 2022 season and the 2024 season, I was honored to be selected as a Section Leader for both corps - leading rehearsals, sectionals, and being a role model for the other members.
									During the winter, yet another professional marching group, the Blue Knights Indoor Drumline
								</p>
								<a href="https://ascendperformingarts.org/ensembles/bkpe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

								</a>
								<p>
									During the winter, I also participate in the Winter Gaurd International (WGI) activity, where I compete with other indoor drumlines.
									I've been a participant in the Blue Knights Indoor Drumline (2022-2025 seasons), where I was also given the opportunity to be a Section Leader for the 2024 & 2025 seasons.
									Since "aging out" of the activity in 2025, I have been given the opportunity to be a Drumline Instructor for the Blue Knights Indoor Drumline for the 2026 season.
