								<h2>Software Development</h2>
								<p>
									Even when I was just a young kid, I had this fascination for computers.
									There was something so seemlessness and impressive about them that drew me to them.
									Maybe it was the speed and efficiency of them, or maybe the fact that there were endless things to do on them.
									I have always loved computers and how they work, so when I found out that I could make it my career, I knew that I had found my calling in life.
								</p>
								<img src="images/idtech_logo.png" alt="Image of ID Tech Logo" class="idtech_logo" width="280px" height="92px">
								<p>
									My experience with coding started young.
									There was a summer camp called "iD Tech," which was held at Colorado State University many years ago.
									There I learned how to make a very simple mod for a video game, but ever since then, I was hooked to the process, and my love for computers only grew stronger.
								</p>
								<p>
									Into highschool and college, I began to dive deeper into the field, and began to learn all the fundamentals of coding. 
									It didn't matter what flavor of Computer Science there was, I was interested in it all. However, I grew particularly fond of Systems Engineering and Software Development.
									The concept of being able to see a problem and do something to solve it is an awesome thing, and I always find fulfillment out of being able to solve problems for other people.
								</p>
								<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/bronson_logo.png" alt="Image of Bronson Logo" class="bronson_logo" width="280px" height="92px"></a>
								<p>
									Bronson is a web development project I've been working on for the University of Wyoming, and has been one of the most exciting projects I have had the privilege to work on while at UW.
									When I first joined the IT department with the Classroom Technology Services (CTS) division, I just started out as a student field technician - going around and fixing the technology in all the classrooms across campus.
									A few years before I joined the team, a couple of the techs had started Bronson as a CTS project, a tool designed to condense all of the tools and services that a student tech needs into one place - a website that can be accessed anywhere on campus.
									Talking with those techs, I became more interested in their goal, and I wanted to contribute. 
									As a field tech I saw a way to add to it with my own tool, Tickex - a tool where techs can look at tickets and respond to support requests.
								</p>
								<p>
									The University of Wyoming uses TeamDynamix's ticketing system to track maintenence requests, issues, tutorials, etc... 
									Our division, CTS, heavily relies on this system, so I saw it fit that Bronson have capabilities to serve tickets to field techs.
									Tickex uses many common web application techniques which includes API handling, user authentication, server side/client side development, and intelligent organization algorithms to function as efficiently as possible - all autonomously!
									It has been a large undertaking, but I am proud to say that Tickex is now fully integrated into Bronson, and is planned for deployment to all field techs in the near future.
								</p>
								<!-- Make a video about Bronson, what it is, and showcase Tickex (the tool I specifically developed) -->
								<!-- TODO: Add Primetime Paradox Logo (if we get one, if not, just some cinematic text works) -->
								<p>
									In order to graduate from the University of Wyoming's Computer Science Department, undergraduates develop a senior capstone project that encapsulates all the skills required of the degree.
									For my senior capstone project, a group of 4 of my peers and I are making a video game called "Primetime Paradox" using the Unity game engine and C# programming language.
									It is a rougue-like rhythm game where the player is dungeon crawling to the beat of the music, fighting enemies, and collecting items along the way. 
									This project has been a great way to learn more about game development, and how to work in a team environment on a complex project.
								</p>
								<p>
									We are making every aspect of the game, from the 3D models, to the music and sound effects, and even the back-end programming and game mechanics that run the game.
									In this project, my job is to act as the sound engineer and back-end systems developer. 
									I am to make sure the game runs smoothly and efficiently.
									Since Primetime Paradox is a rhthm game, I had to make the beat detection system from scratch, and make it portable for all aspects of the game (game mechanics, animation, & event triggering).
									Unity as a game engine has been a great way to learn more about game development and systems development, and I am excited to see where this project takes us!
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Nowadays, I am actively working on web development for the University of Wyoming IT department, working on my senior capstone project, developing various personal projects in my spare time, and keeping my technical skills sharp.
									I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and a person. 
									I always seek to contribute to innovative projects, and am excited for what the future holds!

								<h2>Leadership & Qualifications</h2>
								<p>
									In a lot of aspects of my life, I find myself to be a central figure when it comes to leading groups of people to achieve a common task.
									In some scenarios, there might not even be any proper leadership role, yet I still find myself taking the initiative in many ways.
									I have strong social skills, and I am able to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life, which leads me to being a natural leader in many situations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Talk about academic leadership roles here - National honors society, breifly mention graduating top of my class (already talked about under "Education")
								</p>
								<p>
									Talk about job experiences here - Field Tech at UW IT, Web Developer at UW IT, Restaurant jobs customer service experience
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Leadership in Music</h2>
								<p>
									Starting from highschool and leading up to the present, I was always involved in a vast number of musical ensembles.
									Concert band, jazz band, pep band, and marching band influenced my music education in highschool, and they were a large contributor to my personal growth as a person.
								</p>
								<p>
									I was often selected for first chair in concert bands (All-State concert band as well).
									In jazz band, I was the drumset player for 3 years, and was a major proponent of the rhythm section - helping to keep the band in time and providing a solid foundation which required a lot of confidence in yourself.
									In marching band, I was a Section Leader for my junior year, and then promoted to the band's Drum Major for my senior year. This gave me the opportunity to lead rehearsals, conduct in performances, and be the command between the band directors and the rest of the band members.
								</p>

								</a>
								<p>
									At the University of Wyoming, I have been involved in the Western Thunder Marching Band as a percussionist for the 2021 & 2022 seasons, and have took on the role of Section Leader for the 2022 season.
									After two seasons being a student member, I was promoted to the staff side - being the Drumline Instructor for the 2023, 2024, and 2025 seasons.
									This role involves planning rehearsals, teaching marching techniques, and being a mentor and role model to the percussion section members.
									During the off-season I also offer private drum lessons to members of the percussion section, as well as other students on campus.

								</a>
								<p>
									This trend in music leadership roles did not stop in school. 
									In the professional marching band world of Drum Corps International (DCI), I have been a member of the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (2021 & 2022 seasons) and the Blue Knights Drum and Bugle Corps (2023 & 2024 seasons).
									In the 2022 season and the 2024 season, I was honored to be selected as a Section Leader for both corps - coordinating logistics, leading sectionals, and being a role model for the other members in the drumline.

								</a>
								<p>
									During the winter, I also participated in Winter Gaurd International (WGI), where I competed with other indoor drumlines.
									I was a participant in the Blue Knights Indoor Drumline (2022-2025 seasons), where I was also given the opportunity to be a Section Leader for the 2024 & 2025 seasons.
									I have also received various awards from this ensebmle such as (talk about awards...).
									Since "aging out" of the activity in 2025, I have been given the opportunity to be a Drumline Instructor for the Blue Knights Indoor Drumline for the 2026 season.

								<h2>Music & Audio Technology</h2>
								<p>
									Ever since I was a child, I have been involved in music, taking music lessons as young as 5 year old! 
									Piano and percussion were my main focus growing up. 
									And as I got older, music theory became of interest.
									In highschool I've done many different types of percussion performance, from your standard concerpt percussion, to marching band, and even drumset drumming for a theatrical musical play.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most noteable of my live musician career would be my participation with Drum Corps International (DCI) and Winter Gaurd Internation (WGI) where I was able to play at the highest level of competative percussion performance.
									In DCI, I marched with the Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps (2021 & 2022 seasons) and the Blue Knights Drum and Bugle Corps (2023 & 2024 seasons).
									For both seasons with Battalion, we competed well enough to make Open Class Finals.
									In 2023 I was fortunate enough to compete well enough with the Blue Knights to make it into World Class Finals - the top 12 corps in the world.
									In WGI, I was with the Blue Knight Inddor Percussion Ensemble for the longest (2022-2025 seasons).
									In 2022, I was fortunate enough to compete well enough with the Blue Knights Percussion to make it into World Class Finals - the top 15 percussion ensembles in the world.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									On top of being a live musician and percussionist, I have a considerable amount of music experience in composition with electronic music production, DJing, and live audio technology experience managing and mixing entire stage productions.
									I have recieved my Audio Technology certificate from the University of Wyoming with an emphasis in music production and stage logistics.
								</p>
								<p>
									While at the University of Wyoming, I had the opportunity to work for the Union's Student Technical Services (STS) department, and UWIT's Classroom Technology Services (CTS).
									STS was an AV technician position, where it was my job to setup, sound check, operate, and tear down entire stage sets with live musicians.
									My duties at CTS were to go around campus, installing and monitoring room audio and video systems.
									With both jobs, I had many performances and hundreds of rooms that I have worked where I have run into technical issues I have been able to resolve quickly.
